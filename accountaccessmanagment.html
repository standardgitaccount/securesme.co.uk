        <h1>Managing Passwords</h1>
        <p>Managing passwords securely across multiple accounts within an organisation can be difficult, this is where password managers come in.</p>
        <p>Password managers come in a verity of sizes including some that are online or offline, free or paid. They also come with a verity of security features and learning complexity</p>
        <a href="https://keepassxc.org"><h1>KeePassXC</h1></a>
        <p>KeePassXC is a free and open source password manager created and maintained by the open source community. it is lightly the most secure password manager on this list since 
            the database can be encrypted with multiple factors of authentication: A password, key file, and a security key. This is overkill for most applications as using just two factors of authentication is sufficient.</p>
            <p>KeePassXC can be integrated into the web browser and can also provide the second factor of authentication to most services making it one of the most convenient options. </p>
            <p>We would recommend if you use KeePassXC to use it with a physical security key, such as the Yubikey. The keys can be programmed with a specific number that can be cloned for multiple keys to access the same database. 
            For smaller organisation we would recommend having at least two duplicated keys so if one is lost the other still works. For larger organisations the use of KeePassXC can be implemented by hosting the database on a secure 
            server and allowing employees to access a read only version with the physical security key and a common password. </p>
            <p>KeePassXC has some more advanced features and it is worth taking a look at the documentation <a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/">here.</a></p>
            <br>

            <a href="https://bitwarden.com"><h1>Bitwarden</h1></a>

            and allows you to store and manage your passwords online.</p> <p>One of the standout features of Bitwarden is its cross-platform compatibility.

            <p>Bitwarden also offers two-factor authentication options, including support for authenticator apps and security keys and allows users to share passwords securely with team members.</p>
            <p>Bitwarden has some premium features like encrypted file storage a small annual fee. For larger organizations Bitwarden has enterprise solutions that include user management and reporting features, making it easier
